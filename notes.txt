This code is for a Simple Interest Calculator application built using React.js and Material-UI.

Hereâ€™s a brief description of its main components:

State Variables: The application uses Reactâ€™s useState hook to manage state variables for the principal amount (pamount), rate of interest (rate), time period (time), and the calculated simple interest (result). It also maintains state variables for input validation (validpamount, validrate, validtime).
Input Validation: The validInput function is used to validate the inputs for the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. If the input is valid (greater than 0 and for rate less than or equal to 100), it updates the corresponding state variable and sets the validation state to true. If the input is invalid, it resets the corresponding state variable and sets the validation state to false.
Simple Interest Calculation: The submitted function is triggered when the form is submitted. It checks if all the inputs are valid and then calculates the simple interest using the formula (pamount * rate * time) / 100. The result is then set in the result state variable.
Reset Functionality: The reset function is used to reset all the state variables to their initial values.
User Interface: The application uses Material-UI components to create a user-friendly interface. It includes a form with text fields for entering the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. The calculated simple interest is displayed in a paper component. The form also includes submit and reset buttons.
This application provides a simple and interactive way for users to calculate simple interest based on their inputs. ðŸ˜Š
